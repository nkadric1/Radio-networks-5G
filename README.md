## About app
This application determines the optimal 5G NR configuration (sub-carrier width, frequency band and cyclic prefix) based on road speed, population density and building distribution over a selected area. The user selects an area on a map and the system computes the best network settings based on the average values of the collected data.

Prerequisites - Ensure you have Node.js (v18 or later)  installed on your machine.
